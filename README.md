 Hi, I’m @rnagiuh, or Ravi!
 
 I’m interested in anything to do with programming and devoloping applications. 
 I’m currently a junior undergraduate in a Computer Science program at the University of Houston. 
 I'm available via rsnagi@uh.edu, and look forward to collaborating on any open source project, especially involving applications.
